Strategy.
		dont read lines in a while loop. instead read line, get count and use a for loop.
		write a method for each type of line. do it first writing skeleton methods.
		beware of overflow.
		beware of performance.
		use arrays instead of recursion.
		always flush.
		corner cases.
		Use java.util.Scanner
